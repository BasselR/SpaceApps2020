Hello,

We encountered some technical difficulties in recording a demonstration. These screenshots demonstrate our app in it's current state,
but unfortunately the API keys have been temporarily disabled. This means we don't have a screenshot of the final result.

However, a full demonstration was provided and recorded by Microsoft Teams during hackathon. If possible, please refer to this recording for a proper presentation.

We deeply apologize for the inconvience.
